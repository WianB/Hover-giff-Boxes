# Hover Giff Light Boxes for Sqaurespace


A simple code injection to create hover boxes for giffs on Sqaurespace. (Still in development)

## How to use

Paste code into Sqaurespace and set Giff URLS. Use the relevant container names ie container-half to set the space the giff occupies.

### Note:

1.) Example giffs used are copyrighted and may not be used for any other purpose than to showcase the code and to look good :). Please replace with your own when implementing.

2.) If you don't want any Giffy controls on your Giffs copy the source of the Giff from Giffy by right click and inspecting the Giff.

3.) To get the highest quality Giffs experiment with Giff creators by increasing resolution, reducing frame rate and making the Giffs very short.
